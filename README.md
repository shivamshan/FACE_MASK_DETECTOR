# FACE_MASK_DETECTOR
This face mask detection application detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not.</br>
The CNN model was trained over a mere 1200 images, therefore the accuracy may not be satisfactory.Also the model was trained over generated images of people who were not wearing masks.

Feel free to fork the project and train over more examples.
